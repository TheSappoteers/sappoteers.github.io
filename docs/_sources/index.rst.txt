.. **The Sappoteers welcome you to the Sappo Club!** 

A weekly social event on Friday evenings for CliMet people at the University of Reading and their friends. 

Sappo Club outings are a very informal and loosely organised way to unwind at the end of the week, catch up with old friends and get to know other department members. 

The starting point for Sappo is almost always the SCR (Senior Common Room @ Park House) as it is the closest watering hole to the buildings of the department with people starting to wander over at around 5:30 pm. 

Food, drinks and lively entertainment inevitably follow at the SCR and at other venues that are usually attended afterwards. After the SCR, well anything can happen.

.. note::
  Subscribers to the Met-Social mailing list receive weekly email reminders and flyers advertising the club and signalling the start of the weekend!

Why Sappo?
----------

Sappoing isn't just a club, it's a whole way of life. The Sappoteers say that everything they have learnt in their existence, they have learnt during the Sappo Club!

Although Sappo Club is very informal affair, getting academics to all move in one direction is somewhat akin to herding cats so some organisation is required and someone at least needs to pretend to be in charge. This person is known as The Sappoteer. 

A Sappoteer's role can be broken down into two parts: At some point on a Friday afternoon the duty scientist will send round an e-mail to the department reminding everybody about the club hopefully encouraging people to come along and including a flyer with information about the night ahead. The second task is the to cast any required deciding votes as to destinations visited in the evening.
